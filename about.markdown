Master of Science, currently pursuing a PhD in physics. My research revolves around experimental plasma diagnostics, and I am presently engaged in developing a method for measuring the plasma parameters of an electron cyclotron resonance ion source plasma. The method relies on transient time series analysis and a model based optimization procedure.

I am also a father of one! My days revolve around my toddler, and I am presently engaged in providing her with a safe and supportive home environment. The effort relies on good parenting, and seamless teamwork with my better half. Challenges include a lack of me-time.
